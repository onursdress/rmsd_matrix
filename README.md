# rmsd_matrix
python script for PyMOL (works for me on PyMOL2). 
Calculates the pairwise root-mean-square deviations of Calpha atoms of amino acid chains between all loaded structures.
Returns rmsd matrix and corresponding heatmap.

# short notice
in PyMOL go to "Plugin > Plugin manager > Install New Plugin > Choose File..." and upload/install this script.
call this script by passing "rmsd_matrix" into the PyMOL terminal. 

# python package dependencies
matplotlib, pymol, numpy

# room for improvements
of course. I am not a coder, just a biologist who tries to makes his life easier :-)
